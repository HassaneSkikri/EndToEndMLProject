# Project Setup and Management Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of setting up all the project setup and management

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create a Conda Environment**
   - To create a new environment named `venv` with Python 3.12.1 installed, use the command:
     ```shell
     conda create -p venv python==3.12.1 -y
     ```
   - This creates a separate workspace with the specified version of Python, ensuring project dependencies do not conflict with other projects.

## Step 2: Managing Dependencies

1. **Understanding Dependencies**
   - Dependencies are external libraries or packages required for your project to function correctly. Think of them as ingredients in a recipe needed to make your project work.

## Step 3: Activating the Environment

1. **Activate the Conda Environment**
   - Use the command below to activate the previously created `venv` environment:
     ```shell
     conda activate venv/
     ```
   - Activating an environment ensures you're working within a controlled setting, using specific package versions defined for your project.

## Step 4: Cloning the Project from GitHub

1. **Set Global Configuration**
    
    Configure your Git username and email address:
     ```shell
     git config --global user.email "skikrihassane@gmail.com"
     git config --global user.name "Hassane Skikri"
     ```

2. **Link the Local Repository with GitHub**
   - To connect your local repository to a GitHub project, use:
     ```shell
     git remote add origin https://github.com/HassaneSkikri/...
     ```

3. **Push and Pull Changes**
   - Push local changes to GitHub:
     ```shell
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Pull the latest changes from GitHub:
     ```shell
     git pull origin main
     ```

4. **Create a .gitignore File**
   - Include a `.gitignore` file in your repository to specify untracked files that Git should ignore.


## step 5: add setup and requirements files



- `setup.py` is a configuration file used to specify metadata about your Python project, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It's essential for packaging and distributing your project, allowing others to easily install it with tools like pip.
  

- `requirements.txt` lists the external libraries or packages your project depends on, specifying exact versions for consistency. It's crucial for ensuring that anyone who sets up your project can install the exact dependencies needed, making your project reproducible and reducing conflicts.

## step 6 : create a src folder and inside it __init__.py file 

Creating an` __init__.py` file within a `src` directory for a Python project helps organize code into packages, making it modular and reusable. This setup signals to Python that the directory is a package, facilitating imports within the project. It ensures compatibility across Python versions and follows established Python packaging conventions. The structure aids in maintaining a clean separation between the project's source code and other parts like documentation and tests, streamlining development and deployment processes.

- when you done to build your project you should run this following command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
